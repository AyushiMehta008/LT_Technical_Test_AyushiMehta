### Overview
The `Lampros` function checks whether it's possible to complete all courses based on their prerequisites. It returns `True` if it’s possible (no cycles in the prerequisite graph) and `False` if it's not (a cycle exists, making it impossible to finish all courses).

### Approach
The function uses **Topological Sorting** (specifically **Kahn’s algorithm**) to detect cycles in the course dependency graph.

1. **Graph Creation**: 
   - Create a graph where each node is a course, and an edge `(b, a)` means course `b` must be completed before course `a`.

2. **In-Degree Calculation**: 
   - For each course, calculate its in-degree (the number of courses that must be completed before it).

3. **Queue Setup**: 
   - Initialize a queue with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree of 0).

4. **Course Processing**: 
   - Process each course in the queue, and for each course, reduce the in-degree of courses that depend on it. If any of those dependent courses now have an in-degree of 0, add them to the queue.

5. **Cycle Check**: 
   - If the number of courses completed equals `numCourses`, return `True` (indicating all courses can be completed).
   - If not, return `False` (indicating a cycle exists and not all courses can be finished).

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where `V` is the number of courses (vertices) and `E` is the number of prerequisite pairs (edges).
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for storing the graph and in-degree information.



### How to Use
1. Call `Lampros(numCourses, prerequisites)` where:
   - `numCourses` is the total number of courses.
   - `prerequisites` is a list of pairs, where each pair `[a, b]` means course `b` must be done before course `a`.

2. Example:
   ```python
   numCourses = 3
   prerequisites = [[2, 1], [1, 0]]
   print(Lampros(numCourses, prerequisites))  # Output: True
   ```


### Conclusion
This function checks if it's possible to finish all courses based on prerequisites by using topological sorting to detect cycles in the course dependency graph.
